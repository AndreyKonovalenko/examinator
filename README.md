## Instalation

You can run it on your local machine.

If you familiar with Heroku you can deploy it on your Heroku account after installing it locally.
Package.json file has "heroku-postbuild" script for Heroku deployment.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AndreyKonovalenko/examinator.git
$ cd examinator
```

for server side:

```
$ npm install
```

for client side:

```
$ npm install --prefix client
```

Before run you need setup environment variables in .env
.env file shoud be maulay created in the root folder.

```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://admin:<password>@<clastername>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGO_DB = your_monoDB_name
JWT_SECRET = ****
TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN = 1h
```

For backend you need setup MongoDB, I personally use Atlas cloud database.
So you need first set up you personal Atlas account and create new claster with data base with collection users;
inside collection users youn need create administrator user.

```
"name": "user name",
"username": "admin",
"password": "***",
"admin": true
```

## Important

For password generation use some free online bcrypt Password Generator with 10 Rounds.
If you pass password without encryption, it won't work.

```
npm run prod
```

You can now view app in the browser http://localhost:5000

Now you can login with admin acount, create new users, quizzes, pass quizes, and have fun.
